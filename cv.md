3. Summary (your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why.
Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of experience  Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the workplace . Rather being a Junior means always
learning new things from everywhere etc.).
### Skills and Education
4. Skills (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, methodologies, version control, tools etc.)

**Code examples (LATEST)**
My current  work is related with working with databases using SQL. So I think I'm quite well at
```
Select
  field_1,
  day,
  sum(Case When field_2='yes' then 1 else 0 end) as well
From some_table
Where things='good'
Group By field_1, 
         day
Order by day desc
```
6. Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)
7. Education (including courses, seminars, lectures, online learning)

**English level:** 
Intermidate (B1-B2). I have daily practice at work and regulary attend english classes.
